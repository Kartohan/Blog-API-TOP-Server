# Blog API | TOP Project | Server

This is the server for the project Blog API
This part of project is made in Node JS.

The goal of this Blog API project was to create a blog, create a server that will control the flow of the blog, and create a content manager.

[Assignment from TOP](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/nodejs-blog-api)

What libraries did I use for the server:

1. Express | Express-validator
2. BcryptJS
3. CORS
4. dotenv
5. jsonwebtoken
6. mongoose
7. MongoDB
8. PassportJS | Passport-local | Passport-JWT
9. Multer
10. Luxon

What was done:

1. Authentication with Passport JWT.
2. Authorization with Passport Local
3. Database connection with Mongoose and MongoDB.
4. Validation inputs with express-validator
5. Endpoints for create/read/delete/update posts, authors, categories, comments.
6. Uploading images to posts with Multer.
   and etc...

I am very happy that I was able to complete this project. It was a long journey. Although not everything in this project seems to me complete, but the main thing is that everything works, and I was finally able to create the first full stack application. Thanks "The Odin Project" for that!
